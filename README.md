# ðŸ§© Building and Evaluating Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a notebook, `building_and_evaluating.ipynb`, which provides a **hands-on demonstration of the complete process of developing and assessing a machine learning model**, from data preparation to evaluation metrics.

The notebook walks through each essential stage of the workflow used in real-world predictive modeling projects.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook Structure

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
   - Handle missing values, feature selection, and encoding  
   - Split data into training and test sets  

2. **Model Development**
   - Train supervised models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree  
   - Apply K-Fold Cross Validation for robust performance estimation  
   - Use GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Generate confusion matrix and classification reports  
   - Discuss common pitfalls and interpretation best practices
